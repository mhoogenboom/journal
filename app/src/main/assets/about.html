<h1>Journal...</h1>
<p>
When I started studying again, one of the challenges was keeping organized. I used a journal to keep
track of my study pace. Over the years the journal that started with only study related entries grew.
I jotted down when I travelled, when I went for a ramble. I started to track my runs in the journal.

<h1>... and experiment</h1>
<p>
My journal is just a collection of text documents, organised by year, month and day, one document per
3 years. When I was looking for an idea for some experimental software, this journal was the obvious
candidate. While I believe a piece of software should have a narrow deep scope, and complex solutions should
be assembled from such pieces of software, Journal is more like a Swiss army knife. Sorry about that.
